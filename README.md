# Empty old City – Model H-3

```
Creeping up inside, a will to live, a gear in
place, it starts to run and heat
Thought it was a drop, a drop of rain that just
by chance fell on my face, not from it
Endless sorrow will make up my bones,
contraption parts, they feel so cold, yet they
refuse to stop right now
Every step I take I come closer
Why don’t we survive the silence?
Why don’t we rewrite the finale?
Clasp your fingers tight around mine
Feel my touch, just know we’ll be fine
Break the rules and come with me, won’t you?
Shall we go together, live this through?
Don’t glance back, just look forward
Keep moving on to the dawn
Fugitives like us don’t, belong anywhere
Spend a half night at a motel but
Need to run again
I can hear the sirens’ noise, they’re really
close
They won’t catch us, I’ll be by your side
Cause even when I’m silent you can hear me, my
love
Shifting through the wind, from place to place,
nowhere to hide, can never stop running
Even if I’m hurt, your tears will cure, my pain
and wounds, we’ll keep each other safe
Shadows of your past, cannot emerge, they’re
buried deep, as long as I, am here for you,
bright skies will come
When we need the most, light with us
Why don’t we survive the silence?
Why don’t we rewrite the finale?
Clasp your fingers tight around mine
Feel my touch, just know we’ll be fine
Break the rules and come with me, won’t you?
Shall we go together, live this through?
Don’t glance back, just look forward
Keep moving on
Even if it’s scary we can be, free of this cage
we’re in
For the first time it’s just u and me
Open up your wings and fly into
The dreams we have never seen
Creeping up inside, a will to live, a gear in
place, it starts to run and heat
Thought it was a drop, a drop of rain that just
by chance fell on my face, not from it
Endless sorrow will make up my bones,
contraption parts, they feel so cold, yet they
refuse to stop right now
I will stay by you
